As per E03 we estimated/calculated that our network will have 50 devices in future, In that case i increase the number of switches are i will be replaced  the present with the 24 port switch (HPE Aruba 6000 24G 4SFP Switch - 24-port switch  costs â‚¬ 799.99).I plan according to requirement in the future with different racks and installation.
